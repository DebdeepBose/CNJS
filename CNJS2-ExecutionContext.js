/*

Execution Context is the environment in which JS code is evaluated and executed.

It has 2 components :
➔ Memory Component / Variable Environment: All variables & functions are stored here as key-value pairs.
➔ Code Component / Thread of Execution: It is the component where the code is executed line-by-line.


Javascript is a synchronous, single-threaded language.

➔ Single-Threaded means JS executes one line at a time and has one call stack.
➔ Synchronous means each line of code is executed one after the other & the next line waits for 
   the previous one to finish.
