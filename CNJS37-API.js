// Let's talk about API

/*
Imagine you go to a restaurant and order pasta. Your job is pretty much done,
you don’t have to worry about how it will be made, where they'll get the ingredients from, etc.
It’s the restaurant’s job, so you’re kind of stress-free. APIs work similar to that.

In the old days, we used to get values from the backend in XML format — which was a nightmare.
But now we receive data in the form of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), 
which has made things much easier for us.

// Let's see how JSON looks
`{
  "firstName": "Mark",
  "lastName" : "Grayson"
}`;
// Yeah, it's an object with no name, and both key and value is in string form
